		<p>Philosophy is hard to define. It borders a lot of other areas of study, like Psychology, <br>
		religious study, and even Literature. However the general consensus is that philosophy is at the root <br>
		of human knowledge. It is the study of the nature of knowledge in it self. <br>
		Philosophy answers questions like “what can be known to be real?” and “can we be known to exist?” <br>
		Philosophy also branches into ethics, the study of right, and wrong. Rather than calculating what can be done, <br>
		like science, philosophy asks, “Should it be done?”</p>
