		In philosophy there are two definitions of happiness. There is happiness <br>
		as in a life that goes well for a person leading it,<br>
		and there is the psychological state of happiness. This <br>
		page will focus on the former definition, and weather or not it is truly attainable.

			<p>Ancient Greek philosopher Aristotle was the first philosopher to come up with <br>
			a 'Science of happiness'. Aristotle defines Happiness as 'Eudaimonia' which <br>
			roughly translates to 'human flourishing'. According to Aristotle this state <br>
			of living can be achieved with virtuous activity by means of <br>
			reason. But what does Aristotle mean by this? The <br>
			answer to happiness that Aristotle offers us is that wisdom can <br>
			help us identify morality, and by doing the right thing <br>
			we can be happy with ourselves, and thus live a <br>
			fulfilled life.

			<p>Aristippus of Cyrene, however, argues that only momentary pleasure <br>
			exists, and that there is no such thing as fulfilled <br>
			life of happiness. Aristippus makes this argument with his skeptical <br>
			theory of knowledge. To Aristippus, the past and the <br>
			future cannot be certain to exist, therefore a pleasure you <br>
			feel in the moment is more valuable than a happiness that <br>
			you anticipate. This however does not make Aristippus, and <br>
			the like-minded slaves to their passions, rather he <br>
			argues that with knowledge man can control their nature. This <br>
			idea is best illustrated in his popular quote "Wise people, <br>
			even though all laws were abolished, would still lead <br>
			the same life".
