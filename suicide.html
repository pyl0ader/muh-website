		It's often been implied that suicide is only a psychological <br>
		problem. A chemical imbalance is a term that is often <br>
		tossed around, but hereÂ«s where the borders between <br>
		psychology, and philosophy become wuzzy.  From a philosophical standpoint <br>
		we study the ethics, and reasoning behind suicide as an <br>
		action.

			Confucianism appears to be one of the largest schools of thought in <br>
			the world. These are the teachings of the ancient Chinese <br>
			philosopher Confucius. In the Confucius system of ethics their are <br>
			five moral virtues. Ren, Yi, Li, Zhi, <br>
			and xin. On the topic of suicide we look <br>
			at Ren. Ren denotes the good feeling one gets when <br>
			acting selfless, putting the value of yourself under the value <br>
			of others. In Confucianism suicide is not only permissible in <br>
			the case of doing it for Ren, but it is <br>
			praised. For example, assume by nature you are a <br>
			serial killer, and you have no way of changing that.<br>
			By committing suicide you would be doing a tremendous act <br>
			of selflessness, and in Confucianism you would achieve Ren. <br>
			However this does not answer the question of weather or not life is worth living.

			French-Algerian writer Albert Camus understood the importance of the question <br>
			illustrated in his famous quote "There is but one truly serious <br>
			philosophical problem, and that suicide." To Camus our universe is <br>
			absurd, by that he means that is meaningless, and the <br>
			absurdity comes from the human tendency to create meaning. Camus studies <br>
			the implications of this paradox. To him man has three options <br>
			when he is confronted with the absurd, Create your own meaning <br>
			through religion, Camus argues that by doing this you impoverish yourself <br>
			from the true value of life because you see it in the <br>
			scope of your eternal afterlife. The second is committing suicide, <br>
			To Camus this will only negate the problem rather than solving it.<br>
			Lastly Camus illustrates the solution to the problem in the form <br>
			of a metaphor, The Myth Of Sisyphus. In this book <br>
			sized essay Camus describes Sisyphus, the greek king of Ephyra, <br>
			damned to push a rock up a hill only for it to <br>
			fall back down again for the rest of eternity, Fully understanding <br>
			his futility, and hopeless labor, Camus encourages us to imagine Sisyphus <br>
			happy, revolting against the absurdity of his existence.
