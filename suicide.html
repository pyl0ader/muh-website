		It's often been implied that suicide is only a psychological 
		problem. A chemical imbalance is a term that is often <br>
		tossed around, but hereÂ«s where the borders between 
		psychology, and philosophy become wuzzy.  From a philosophical standpoint <br>
		we study the ethics, and reasoning behind suicide as an 
		action.

			Confucianism appears to be one of the largest schools of thought in <br>
			the world. These are the teachings of the ancient Chinese <br>
			philosopher Confucius. In the Confucius system of ethics their are <br>
			five moral virtues. Ren, Yi, Li, Zhi, <br>
			and xin. On the topic of suicide we look <br>
			at Ren. Ren denotes the good feeling one gets when <br>
			acting selfless, putting the value of yourself under the value <br>
			of others. In Confucianism suicide is not only permissible in <br>
			the case of doing it for Ren, but it is <br>
			praised. For example, assume by nature you are a <br>
			serial killer, and you have no way of changing that.<br>
			By committing suicide you would be doing a tremendous act <br>
			of selflessness, and in Confucianism you would achieve Ren. <br>
			However this does not answer the question of weather or not life is worth living.

			French-Algerian writer Albert Camus understood the importance of the question <br>
			illustrated in his famous quote "There is but one truly serious philosophical problem,<br>
			and that suicide." To Camus our universe is absurd, by that he means that is <br>
			meaningless, and the absurdity comes from the human tendency to create meaning. Camus <br>
			studies the implications of this paradox. To him man has three options when he is confronted<br>
			with the absurd, Create your own meaning through religion, Camus argues that by doing<br>
			this you impoverish yourself from the true value of life because you see it in the scope of <br>
			your eternal afterlife. The second is committing suicide, To Camus this will only negate the <br>
			problem rather than solving it. Lastly Camus illustrates the solution to the problem <br>
			in the form of a metaphor, The Myth Of Sisyphus. In this book sized essay Camus describes <br>
			Sisyphus, the greek king of Ephyra, damned to push a rock up a hill only for it to fall<br>
			back down again for the rest of eternity, Fully understanding his futility, and hopeless<br>
			labor, Camus encourages us to imagine Sisyphus happy, revolting against the absurdity of <br>
			his existence.
