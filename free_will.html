		<p>Free will is the human ability to make a self-determined decision. 
		Freedom seems like such a basic principle that it&#8217;s ridiculous to sa 
		we are not free, right?</p>

			<p>American philosopher, and psychologist William James, chose to <br>
			believe that his will was free, however he has published a lot of work <br>
			for the doctrine of Determinism. Determinism says that all events are a <br>
			direct cause of a passed event. To James, Determinism rejects the <br>
			existence of chance, or human agency (free will). To put it another <br>
			way, determinism implies that humans are machines that are governed by <br>
			the mechanical laws of nature, and free will is simply an illusion. <br>
			This argument however is very materialistic. What does the human <br>
			experience say about free will?<br>

			<p>Existentialist jean-paul Sartre argues that not only are we free but <br>
			we are condemned to be free. That man is born nothing, and is forced to <br>
			create himself through his actions.&nbsp; Sartre refers to this idea as <br>
			radical freedom, and determinism is merely a self-deceptive excuse to <br>
			act as though we are not free. Sartre&#8217;s argument for freedom was born <br>
			from phenomenology, the study of the human experience.&nbsp; In his <br>
			essay Existentialism is a Humanism Sartre famously said &#8220;Existence <br>
			precedes essence&#8221; what Sartre means by this is that for objects like a <br>
			computer, it&#8217;s essence (being the sum of all it&#8217;s formulae, or it&#8217;s <br>
			blueprint) comes before it&#8217;s existence, while a Human first exist, then <br>
			creates her essence through actions. To put it simply we decide who we <br>
			are, and nothing else can determine who we want to be.&nbsp; <br>
